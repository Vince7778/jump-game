                <h4>Overview</h4>
                <p>
                    The objective of this game is to get the most points.<br>
                    You control a player with only two moves: "invent" and "jump".<br>
                    Jumping is simple: a jump by the vector [x, y] makes your player moves x units down and y units right. (Be careful, since these directions do not align with the normal coordinate plane.)<br>
                    However, you cannot jump an amount without first inventing that jump. If you want to jump by [x, y], you must invent the vector [x, y] first.<br>
                    Also, only one player can invent each vector! So if someone invents the vector [1, 2] before you do, you will never be able to jump that distance.<br>
                    If you jump and land on a point, you will gain that point. The point will then be removed.<br>

                <h4>Turns</h4>
                <p>
                    This game is a mix between real-time games and turn-based games.<br>
                    Every 1 second (default), a new turn starts. Players make decisions between turns, and all decisions are executed at the same time at the start of a turn.<br>
                    By default, inventing takes 4 turns to complete, and jumping takes 1 turn. A game lasts 300 turns.<br>
                    The simultaneous nature of turns means that some conflicts can happen.<br>
                    If two players try and invent the same vector on the same turn, both of them fail.<br>
                    If two players try and jump to the same cell on the same turn, both of them fail.<br>
                    You cannot jump to a cell occupied by another player, even if that player moves away the next turn.
